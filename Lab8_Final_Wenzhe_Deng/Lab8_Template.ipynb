    "### **a. Data Size and Structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dataset Size**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The dataset includes thousands of labeled EEG samples, each 50 seconds long, sampled at **200 Hz** across multiple electrode channels.\n",
    "  * Data is large: each EEG sample has `200 Hz × 50 s = 10,000` timepoints per electrode channel.\n",
    "  * EEG files are stored in `/train_eegs/` and `/test_eegs/`; spectrograms (generated from EEG data) are also available.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Structure**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **`train.csv`** is the primary metadata file linking EEG and spectrogram samples to expert-labeled classifications.\n",
    "  * Each row in `train.csv` corresponds to a **specific labeled segment** within a longer EEG recording.\n",
    "  * Labels are provided by **multiple experts**. Each class has an associated **vote count**.\n",
    "  * There are six target categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `seizure`, `lpd`, `gpd`, `lrda`, `grda`, `other`\n",
    "  * Labeling is done on the **central 10 seconds** of each 50s EEG window (i.e., the labels refer to seconds 20–30).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Types**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Raw EEG time series (per electrode channel)\n",
    "  * Spectrograms (frequency-domain representation)\n",
    "  * Metadata (e.g., offset, patient ID, annotator votes)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Overlap**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Many EEG windows **overlap**. The dataset consolidates overlapping regions with associated metadata to extract relevant segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **File Format**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Data is stored in `.parquet` format with columns as electrode names (e.g., `Fp1`, `F3`, `EKG`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **b. Data Cleanness**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Potential Noise**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * EEG data is inherently **noisy**, with possible contamination from muscle movement, eye blinks, and environmental interference.\n",
    "  * The **EKG** channel is included, which can sometimes help with artifact detection (e.g., removing heartbeat interference).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Label Noise**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Even trained annotators **disagree** — hence vote counts are provided per class rather than a single deterministic label.\n",
    "  * The column `expert_consensus` offers a simplified label but should be used cautiously due to possible inter-rater disagreement.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Simulator limitations**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * This dataset is **real-world**, not simulated. However, **sampling frequency and electrode coverage** may limit some types of fine-grained analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **c. Diversity of Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Feature Space**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Each EEG sample consists of multiple channels (electrode signals), each with 10,000 data points (50s × 200Hz).\n",
    "  * Spectrograms provide time-frequency representations, increasing feature diversity across frequency bins and brain regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Labels**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * There are 6 multi-label classification targets; each sample can have **multiple** brain activity types (i.e., it's **multi-label**).\n",
    "  * Label distribution is **highly imbalanced** — seizure events are **rare**, while “other” may be common.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Patient Diversity**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Samples come from different patients (`patient_id` is included), and cross-patient variation (e.g., age, pathology) could affect generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Conclusion**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The dataset is rich and complex, with both time-domain and frequency-domain inputs, weak supervision (due to annotator disagreement), and a multi-label output space.\n",
